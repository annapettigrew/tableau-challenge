Citibike Rides January - March 2022 - New York

During the late winter months of 2022 we set out to see how many rides New Yorkers were taking and collecting enough data to see where the most rides are coming in and going out from. Where were these over 1.1 million rides headed to and why?

In this analysis three separate CSV files were used and gathered from the Citi Bike Data webpage --> https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data 

Next, I combined these files in a jupyter notebook to create one large CSV file

In Tableau I created visualizations, two dashboards and a story to interpret this data

Charts included in this story: 
- A total ride count
- A monthly ride count
- Peak Hours
- Most popular Start and End Stations
- Static Maps

A couple of examples of the charts included in the analysis:

What was discovered:

- January is immensely more popular with riders than February and March.
   - January may have peaked as well because of the holidays and New Years Eve being very popular in the city.
   - Snow in February could be a factor of low trip count among riders.
- Peak hours for January through March seem to corelate being around  10 am and 4 pm.
        - This strongly allignes with work hours from 9-5pm
- All but two locations match up with the most popular stations and least popular stations. 
     - This may be due to popular office buildings in the area or perhaps tourist attractions in the area. 
     - Each of these locations is a popular street or well known area of the city.
